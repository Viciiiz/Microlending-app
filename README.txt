COURSE- SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

Groupmembers: Victor R, Aleks K, Miraj B

PURPOSE:

This is the repository for Dr. Lewis's Software Engineering course. The purpose of this project is to create a banking platform that allows users to access small interest loans. With our application, users are able to both access their regular account, and if they are a manager at the firm, they are able to access a managers-only page. 



INSTRUCTIONS:

-If you wish to make a manager-level account, the email ending must be "MicroLendingMgmt.com" when registering. This allows the program
to then set the account with that status level in the Firebase Realtime DB!
-To reset password, make sure to use a valid email address.
-On iOS, the "do you want to save this password" prompt can send the user back to the login page. Deny (or accept) the prompt, and it won't repeat the error for that session.

Tools and Frameworks Used:
React Native with Expo
Firebase DB and Firebase Authentication

Responsibilities:
To add a user to the site.
The ability to  add ‘micro-dollars’ to their account.
To create a bank manager login
For a bank manager to specify interest rates
For a bank manager to be able to create different banking/loan pool categories
To have a user be able to be able to create multiple accounts
To have a user specify how much micro-dollars to automatically go into the banking/loan pool(s)
For the user to request a loan from any of the loan pools.
